** - Update Mockdata

*/ - Remove flyout items list.
	We do not want to show all our 100 contacts in our flyout items.
	However we should not do this hastily as it could break our code.
	And also the code pages serve as a good reference point.

** - Possibly split profile into an overview and separate edit page.
	Then repurpose static profile for when user wants to see other users profiles.
